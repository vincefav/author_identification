# author_identification
Kaggle competition to identify horror writers from brief passages. Here's the contest's description:

*The competition dataset contains text from works of fiction written by spooky authors of the public domain: Edgar Allan Poe, HP Lovecraft and Mary Shelley. The data was prepared by chunking larger texts into sentences using CoreNLP's MaxEnt sentence tokenizer, so you may notice the odd non-sentence here and there. Your objective is to accurately identify the author of the sentences in the test set.*
